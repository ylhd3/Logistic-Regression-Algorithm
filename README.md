# Logistic Regression Algorithm
This repository contains a logistic regression algorithm that classifies multimedia posts as 'real' or 'fake' based on text content.

The python file contains the 34 iterations I took to test and improve the algorithm in order to achieve the following metrics to 2 d.p.:

Accuracy:  88.04%\
Specificity:  94.78%\
Recall:  73.86%\
Precision:  87.04%\
F1-score:  79.91%\
AUC:  84.32%

The full metrics used for each iteration can be found in the 'Iteration_results' folder.
